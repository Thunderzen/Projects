#Welcome to Fibonacci calculator
# The Fibonacci Sequence is the sequence of numbers, obtained by addition of the previous 2 terms
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
  

#Created using a recursive function
#2 types of recursion,namely tail and non-tail recursions
#Tail recursion-function calls itself at the end in which no computation is done after the return of the recursive call


# Pattern observations:
# Fibonacci(1)-->Returns 0
# Fibonacci(2)-->Returns 1
# Fibonacci(3)-->Returns 1, Finonacci(3-1)+Fibonacci(3-2)
# Fibonacci(4)-->Returns Fibonacci(4-1)+Fibonacci(4-2)
# Fibonacci(5)-->Returns Fibonacci(5-1)+Fibonacci(5-2)



def fibonacci(term):
    #term=1 and 2 are base cases
    if term==1:
        return 0
    elif term==2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(term-1)+fibonacci(term-2)
